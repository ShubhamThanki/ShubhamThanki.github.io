								<h3>Respected Recruiters</h3>
								<p>
									I am writing to express my enthusiasm for opportunities in data analysis, business analysis, and project management. With a solid foundation in data analysis, financial reporting, and project management, I am eager to contribute my skills and experience to a dynamic and forward-thinking organization.

									My educational background includes an Post Graduation in Information Technology Business Analysis from Conestoga College and a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering from Marwadi University. These programs have equipped me with a strong understanding of technical skills such as SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and many other professional tools </br></br>

									My hands-on experience with these tools allows me to perform core analysis, report crafting, trend identification, and dashboard creation effectively.


									One of my notable projects, "Data Analysis of Layoffs Data Set Using SQL," involved conducting exploratory data analysis on post-COVID layoff trends to understand market dynamics and workforce changes. I utilized advanced SQL techniques to identify significant patterns in layoff trends across different industries, regions, and time periods, providing valuable insights to stakeholders.

								</br></br>Another significant project, "Enhancing Operational Efficiency Using Business Analysis," involved conducting business analysis for well known Bank to address challenges related to interest rates, customer base management, and overall operational efficiency. By bridging technical challenges and business strategy, I developed long-term data management tools and solutions that improved operational efficiency.

									My professional experiences have honed my problem-solving, critical thinking, and communication skills, making me adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams to develop and implement effective analytics solutions. 
									
							</br></br>I am committed to excellence and continuous improvement, and I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of any organization.

									I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences align with your needs.

									</br></br>
